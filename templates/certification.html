                                                    several times since then. The latest version, ISO 27001:2022, was
                                                    released in October 2022 and includes new and enhanced requirements

                                                    <li>Improved reputation: A Sedex audit can help a company to improve
                                                        its reputation by demonstrating its commitment to ethical and

                                                        abuses or environmental damage.</li>
                                                    <li>Increased sales: Some customers require their suppliers to have
                                                        a Sedex audit, so having one can help a company to win new

                                                <p>RCS stands for 'Recycled Claim Standard'. RCS is an international,

                                                    product. Unlike the Global Recycled Standard (GRS), RCS focuses
                                                    solely on ensuring accurate recycled content claims without
                                                    requiring additional social and environmental assessments. At

                                                        sustainability standards. To achieve this level, a building must
                                                        meet certain prerequisites and earn a minimum number of credits

                                                    <li>LEED Gold: This level requires even more credits than Silver and

                                                    minimum of 40 credits to achieve LEED Certified status, while a
                                                    project seeking LEED Platinum would need to earn a minimum of 80

                                                <p>The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification is an
                                                    internationally recognized system that verifies that wood products
                                                    come from responsibly managed forests. FSC-certified forests are
                                                    managed according to strict environmental, social, and economic
                                                    standards, which helps to ensure that they are being conserved for
                                                    future generations.</p>
                                                <p>There are two main types of FSC certification: forest management
                                                    certification and chain of custody certification. Forest management
                                                    certification ensures that the forest itself is being managed
                                                    responsibly, while chain of custody certification tracks the wood
                                                    from the forest to the final product to ensure that it has not been
                                                    mixed with uncertified wood.</p>
                                                <p>FSC certification is a valuable tool for consumers who want to be
                                                    sure that the wood products they are buying are coming from
                                                    sustainable sources. It is also important for businesses that want
