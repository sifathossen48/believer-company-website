                                                        safety requirements of the EU's legislation. The CE mark is a
                                                        symbol that is placed on a product to show that it meets these

                                                    <p>CE Marking is the process of affixing the CE mark to a product,
                                                        and it involves a series of tests and assessments to ensure that
                                                        the product meets the necessary standards. The CE mark is
                                                        required for a wide range of products, including machinery,

                                                    <p>There are several directives and regulations that govern the CE
                                                        marking process, including the Machinery Directive, the
                                                        Electrical Machinery Directive, the Medical Devices Directive,
                                                        and the Construction Products Regulation. These directives
                                                        outline the essential health and safety requirements that
                                                        products must meet in order to be eligible for the CE mark.</p>
                                                    <p>To obtain the CE mark, a product must undergo a conformity
                                                        assessment procedure, which typically involves testing,
                                                        inspection, and certification by a Notified Body or a
                                                        self-certification process. The conformity assessment procedure
                                                        varies depending on the type of product and the category of the
                                                        directive that applies to it.</p>
                                                    <p>Once a product has been assessed and found to meet the necessary
                                                        requirements, the CE mark can be affixed to the product,
                                                        packaging, or instruction manual. The CE mark consists of the
                                                        letters "CE" surrounded by a circle, and it indicates that the
                                                        product complies with the essential health and safety
                                                        requirements of the EU's legislation.</p>
                                                    <p>It's important to note that the CE mark is not a guarantee of a
                                                        product's quality or performance, but rather a statement that
                                                        the product meets the minimum legal requirements for health and
                                                        safety. Additionally, the CE mark does not necessarily mean that
                                                        a product is allowed to be sold in all countries outside of the
                                                        EU, as other countries may have their own regulatory
                                                        requirements that need to be met.</p>
